# Small Is Going Big: Go on Microcontrollers

Go is powerful, but has not been able to run on very small hardware, until now. Introducing TinyGo http://tinygo.org

Go is very powerful, but has not been able to run on very small hardware, until now. Introducing TinyGo http://tinygo.org

In this talk I will show TinyGo, a new Go compiler designed to bring the Go programming language to constrained devices such as microcontrollers.

There will be lots of live demonstrations of TinyGo running on hardware such as Arduino, BBC micro:bit. and many more very small computing platforms.
